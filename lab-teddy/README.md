# Description:

### For this Lab I was supposed to make a cow say something by using the server.js file to access the code to accomplish what you need. The Terminal is the way that you run the code and make things run and work. the code markup below is how to run it in your code. You are also able to use different animals like a dragon.

## Code's for NPM:

### To start Server:

`nodemon server.js`

### NPM starting lint:

`npm run lint`
